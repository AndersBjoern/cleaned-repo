      <h3>Skilled in Project Management</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have gained project management experience through roles such as Scrum
        Master, consultant and team coordinator, all of which have involved
        adapting to constraints and frequent communication with the team and
        stakeholders
      </p>

      <h3>Expertise in prototype development</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        All of my project examples are based on iterative prototype development
        and testing.

      <h3>Using Unity to bring concepts to life</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I translate concepts into digital realities through Unity. I have used
        unity for e.g. VR & AR projects, multiplayer games and communication
        with databases.
